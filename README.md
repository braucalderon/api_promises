### Why we're using Axios

Axios is a library that helps us make http requests to external resources. In our React applications we often need to retrieve data from external APIs so it can be displayed in our web page.


##### Axios Features

Make XMLHttpRequests from the browser.
Make http requests from node.js.
Supports the Promise API.
Intercept request and response.A
Transform request and response data.
Cancel requests.
Automatic transforms for JSON data.
Client side support for protecting against XSRF.


### Difference between State and Props

"props" (short for "properties") is an object of arbitrary inputs a React function component accepts as the first argument. "state" is data that changes over the lifetime of a specific instance of a React component.


### Route Component

The Route component is perhaps the most important component in React Router to understand and learn to use well. Its most basic responsibility is to render some UI when its path matches the current URL. [For More Information On Route!](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Route).


### Link Component (To: String)

A link component provides declarative, accessible navigation around your application. (to: string) A string representation of the Link location, created by concatenating the locationâ€™s pathname, search, and hash properties.[For More Information On Link!](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Link/to-string).
