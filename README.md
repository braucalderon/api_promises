### Why we're using axios

Axios is a library that helps us make http requests to external resources. In our React applications we often need to retrieve data from external APIs so it can be displayed in our web pages.

### Difference between State and Props

"props" (short for "properties") is an object of arbitrary inputs a React function component accepts as the first argument.
"state" is data that changes over the lifetime of a specific instance of a React component.
